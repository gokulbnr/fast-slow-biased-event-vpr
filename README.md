# Enhancing Visual Place Recognition via Fast and Slow Adaptive Biasing in Event Cameras

Code and Dataset coming soon!

## Dataset

Link the the dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/gokulbnr/QCR-Fast-Slow-Event-Dataset

## Data Recording

The event streams were recorded using the [jAER](https://github.com/SensorsINI/jaer)v1.9.5 library for a [DAVIS346Red](https://inivation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DAVIS346.pdf) device. Information regarding setting up the jAER can be found in it's [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fb7VA8tdoxuYqZfrPfT46_wiT1isQZwTHgX8O22dJ0Q/edit#heading=h.en40wtalica4).
